As its name implies, this skin owes much to the Kodi community. In no particular order, I'd like to thank the following individuals:

- BigNoid, for developing Aeon Nox, on which this skin is based.
- Jeroen, for creating reFocus and some of the views included here.
- BobCratchett, for creating the skinshortcuts script and updating Mimic to use its latest features.
- Phil65, for the ExtendedInfo script and the selected item animation that is used throughout Mimic.
- Marcelveldt, for the skin helper service that makes the colour picker and so many other things possible.
- JurialMunkey, for Arctic Zephyr, which was the inspiration for the header and several other features.

And finally, all of the users, translators, testers, and fans of Mimic.
